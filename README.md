# One-dimensional BFB gasifier model

:warning: This project is a work in progress. Some things may not work correctly yet.

## Usage

Execute the `main.py` file to run the model.

```bash
$ python main.py
```

## Reference

This code is based on the one-dimensional fluidized bed gasification model discussed in the Agu et al. 2019 paper.
